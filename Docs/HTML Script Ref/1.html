<A name=1><h2>1.  Concepts</h2>
  <FONT face=Verdana size=2>Before scripting your first mission 
  or scenario, read this section to get familiar with several basic concepts.

    size=2><BR>Scripts must be designed to run both on the server side and 
    client side. However, many functions in this API will only execute server 
    side for obvious reasons. Those functions have an asterisk (*) appended in 
    this documentation. <BR>Use the isServer() and isClient() functions to 
    determine if the script is running server side or on one of the 
    clients.<BR></FONT><BR>
    <LI><A name=1.2><B><I><FONT face=Arial size=4>Object ID’s</A> 
    </B></I></FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2><BR>Objects within the game can be 
    identified by their key or by their name. The most reliable way to find and 
    use an object is by it’s key, which is a 64-bit number that uniquely 
    identifies that object. <BR>Names can be used as well, but in some cases 
    multiple objects may have the same name (i.e. infantry on a planet are all 
    named infantry) additionally finding by name is much slower because it 
    requires a search. <BR>All script functions that require an id as a 
    parameter will firstly assume the id is a key, if not found by the key, then 
    they will search by name for the object. <BR>Any script functions that 
    create an object will always return the key of the object. Use getName() to 
    get the name of an object by it’s key. Use getKey() to get the key for an 
    object by name. <BR>&nbsp; 
    <LI><A name=1.3></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Arial size=4>Teams / 
    Factions</A> </B></I></FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2><BR>Any one faction 
    can have any number of teams. This is to facilitate the clan/fleet system in 
    game, thus when a clan member joins a game server a team for their clan is 
    dynamically created if needed. <BR>&nbsp; 
    <LI><A name=1.4></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Arial size=4>Mission 
    Scripts</A></B></I></FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2><BR>These 
  scripts are designed to provide a story/missions for the players. They are 
  started by a moderator, and can remain running until the server is terminated 
  or reset. Normally, they will initiate some starting conditions then 
  eventually run their course and end. However, mission scripts can also be 
  designed to continuously provide missions and motivation for the players. 
  <BR>Mission scripts can also communicate, since they are all share the same 
  environment. This means global variables and functions can all be shared. 
  However, this can also be a source of problems, since a function from one 
  script might replace a needed function in another script of the same name. 
  <BR>All mission scripts should have their title, requirements, and description 
  at the top of the file.<B><I> <BR>-- TITLE: ICC Diplomatic Mission <BR>-- REQ:
