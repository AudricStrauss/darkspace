  <FONT face=Verdana size=2>These functions are called by the 
  game into the script after certain events.&nbsp; </font>
  <font size="2" face="Arial">Callbacks ( initiated by remoteCall, startTimer, 
  watchKey etc... ) are &quot;broadcasted&quot; at the destination. The destination 
  receives the call and executes this in the context of all running scripts. 
  This allows scripts to communicate, however all defined functions also need 
  unique names or to be defined within a namespace to prevent &quot;accidental&quot; calls 
  of a function from another script running at the same time</font><FONT face=Verdana size=2>&nbsp; 
  If any callback fails, </font><font size="2" face="Arial">the error message is 
  only displayed if enableAlerts(1) was executed previously</font><FONT face=Verdana size=2>.
