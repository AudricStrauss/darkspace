The War Begins in Luyten 726
]
[
m_Description
The conflict has finally erupted into war! The UGTO are making a bold move on the Luyten system (a neutral system close to ICC home space) in an effort to gain a "beach-head" from which to launch further operations. ICC intelligence has had plenty of forewarning regarding the upcoming assault so neither side has the element of surprise. This will be the first chance for each side to feel the other out and may very well have an outstanding effect on the outcome of the entire war.

The UGTO have shown the ICC that it is futile to attempt to rebel against the forces of civilization in the universe! This battle is only the first step in showing the ICC that their rebellion is complete foolishness. Before moving into ICC home space the UGTO will now take control of the 61 Cygnus system in order to further strengthen their presence in this sector.
