m_Description
Home away from home for the alien K'Luth, the sanctuary of Sirius is replete with beautiful and bizarre cloaking organic vessels ranging from station analogs to massive colony vessels. Newcomers to human space, the K'luth hail from distant starts besieged by a great and mysterious threat. Though defeated and fleeing, the K'luth are well-equipped for the struggles in this area of space: wielding exotic technologies and heavily utilizing antimatter, the K'luth have carved a minor empire for themselves in the human quadrant, and will fiercely defend it against human warships.
