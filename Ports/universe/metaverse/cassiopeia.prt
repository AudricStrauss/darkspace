m_Description
The jewel of the ICC, CD-36 is the home of the governing authorities of the Confederation on Exathra. So far from the influence of the UGTO, the system was crucial as a haven for representatives from the struggling colonies of an empire lax on defense against piracy to gather and declare independence, the spring from which colonial sovereignty would flow.
